                                    For the last many years, India has been the birthplace of some of the finest tech talent in the world. In the last 5 years, digitisation in India has grown dramatically, a phenomenon that accelerated further as the pandemic forced people into homes and onto the internet. As an industry, and indeed, the country, we have a greater need than ever before for a pipeline of agile, brilliant young minds to help write the next chapter of India’s digitisation journey. The Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) program aims to empower student developers in universities to impact their student communities through technology. The program helps students bridge the gap between theory and practice in understanding the intersections between social groups, technology and user behaviour. Today, we are pleased to announce that applications for GDSC leads for the upcoming 2022-2023 academic year are now open. Students can apply at goo.gle/gdsc-leads.
